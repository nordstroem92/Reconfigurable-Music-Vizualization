My Master's Thesis was about visualizing music notation in a modular way, that could be reordered easily to accomodate the musicians need - Whether that need was to learn theoretical concept, analyse or even reharmonize a musical piece. My thesis report can be seen here [a relative link](Masters_thesis_Christian_Nordstrom_Rasmussen.pdf)

The prototype of the concept was implemented in JS and D3.js and focused heavily on creating coherency between the different representations through transitions.
